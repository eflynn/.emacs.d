* Keywords

  A keyword is a symbol whose name starts with `:'. Keywords evaluate
  to themselves and cannot be changed. Any attempt to set or bind a
  keyword is an error, except setting a keyword to itself.

* Active primary keymaps

  "Active" means in use for finding key bindings.

  Global map is shared by all buffers.
  Local keymap is associated with a specific major mode.
  Minor mode keymaps are associated with currently enabled minor modes.

  Local keymap bindings shadow the global bindings.
  Minor mode keymaps shadow both local and global keymaps.
